**CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**

It is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a specific user will leave a service or not,
When predicting customer churn, several features are commonly used. Keep in mind that the specific features can vary based on the dataset and business context, but here are some common ones:

**This project aims to predict whether a specific user will leave a service or not.**

It involves extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and deployment of a Streamlit web application for user interaction.

**Key features:**

1.Trained machine learning model for customer churn prediction.

2.Streamlit web application for user-friendly interaction with the model.

3.Detailed EDA to gain insights into the dataset.

4.Optimization of model parameters using RandomizedSearchCV.
